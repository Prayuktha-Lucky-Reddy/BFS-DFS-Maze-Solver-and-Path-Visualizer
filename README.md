# BFS–DFS Maze Solver (C++)

A C++ program that solves a **user-defined maze** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

The user can specify the maze dimensions, add walls, choose start and end coordinates,
and select whether to run BFS or DFS for path finding.

## Features
- Custom maze dimensions and wall placement
- User-defined start and end points
- Choice between BFS and DFS traversal
- Console-based path visualization

## Files
- `main.cpp` — Maze creation and BFS/DFS path finding
